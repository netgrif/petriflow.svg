> Visual library for Petriflow objects

Petriflow.SVG is a Angular library for visual representation of Petriflow objects. The library is for rendering and
modeling
Petriflow objects as SVG elements.
The library offers component that is functionally container for SVG objects. Within the component a user can draw/model
a Petriflow process.
The library is updated together with the Petriflow specification to ensure up-to-date compatibility.

Full specification of Petriflow low-code language can be found at [Petriflow.com](https://petriflow.com)

The library is based on the library Petri.SVG that is also developed in this project (folder projects/petri-svg).
Petri.SVG is pure Typescript library of visual representation (SVG elements) of Petri Nets components.
For more information see [Petri.SVG](../../projects/petri-svg).

## Install

First, make sure you have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm with it (You may need to restart your computer
after this step).

You can install it with the following command:

```shell
npm install --save @netgrif/petriflow.svg
```

### Requirements

As the library is an Angular library the main dependency is Angular 13 and its modules.
For more information about dependencies see [the library package.json](../../projects/petriflow-svg/package.json).

Since npm v7+ does not install peer dependencies you need to install them yourself. Please
see `peerDependencies` attribute in [the library package.json](../../projects/petriflow-svg/package.json).

## Usage

The library publishes Angular component `petriflow-svg-canvas` that represent drawing canvas for SVG objects.
The component does not have any inputs or
output. [See documentation for more information.](https://netgrif.github.io/petriflow.svg)
